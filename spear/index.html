                <i>Syriac Persons, Events, and Relations Project (SPEAR)</i> is a prosopographical reference work designed to provide information about persons and their relationships within the context of historical events. <i>SPEAR</i> uses a "factoid" approach to prosopography that seeks to capture data points asserted in historical texts. A factoid differs from a fact in that it indicates an assertion made by a primary source text, rather than a piece of information that a modern editor affirms as true. This approach allows for the fullest dataset possible and captures data of particular importance for social history. For example, a fictional biography of a saint can still reveal a great deal of information about how people understood saints and the town councilors, clergy, and peasants with whom they interacted. The factoid approach is critical for creating a database of use to social historians as well as historians of the political or religious institutions upon which traditional print prosopographies have focused.</p>
            <p>
                <i>SPEAR</i> aims to provide scholars in Syriac Studies, Classics, Byzantine, and Islamic Studies access to a reference work containing information on all of the individuals and groups appearing in the Syriac texts included in the database. <i>SPEAR</i> will offer multiple search fields enabling researchers to return hits for a wide variety of queries and analyze relationships between ethnicity, language, occupation, religious confession, etc. Furthermore, each piece of data will direct the user to a specific citation in one or more primary source texts.</p>
            <p>An initial data model of <i>SPEAR</i> is nearing completion using data from the Syriac "Chronicle of Edessa." Sample entries from this data are available below.</p>
