                <i>A Guide to Syriac Authors</i> is a digital publication designed to serve as a name and biographic  authority record documenting authors relevant to the study of Syriac literature. <i>A Guide to Syriac Authors</i> is a sub-collection within a larger reference work <i>The Syriac Biographical Dictionary (SBD)</i>. The aim of <i>A Guide to Syriac Authors</i> is to provide a unique identifing entry for every author included in the reference work. All entries must include at least one specific primary or secondary source citation and most entries also contain name variant information. When possible some entries contain greater biographical detail although such detail is not the foremost goal of the publication. The overarching purpose is to provide a unique identifier (a <a href="http://syriaca.org/exist/apps/srophe/documentation/terms.html#uri">URI</a>, uniform resource identifier) for each Syriac author to facilitate cataloguing of Syriac literary works and the creation of linked data both within Syriaca.org and externally with Syriaca.org's digital collaborators.</p>
            <p>Because <i>A Guide to Syriac Authors</i> is designed as an aid cataloguing and historical research, the sole criteria for inclusion of entries is relevance to the study of Syriac literaure. "Relevant authors" therefore include not only authors who wrote in the classical Syriac language or modern Neo-Aramaic dialects, but also a broader range of authors including ancient and modern authors whose works have been translated into Syriac. When relevant, entries have also been made for authors who did not write in Syriac but who are named or cited in Syriac texts. Entries have also been created for authors in dialogue with Syriac literature who wrote in the many languages neighboring the Syriac traditions (Arabic, Armenian, Malayalam, etc).  There are no temporal or spatial boundaries for the database, which collects data on persons from any period past or present useful for Syriac studies, from authors credited in Syriac biblical translations to members of the contemporary diaspora communities. Similarly, historicity is not a selection criteria. <i>A Guide to Syriac Authors</i> includes entries on pseudonymous, uncertain, and anonymous authors when they are of significance for research on Syriac culture and sufficient citation information is available to uniquely distinguish each identity. Each entry is a conceptual person or group with a mental existence related to, but not reducible to, its historical manifestation.  Authors in the database can be annotated with relationships to other persons, and they will link with other Syriaca.org resources, such as places in <i>The Syriac Gazetteer</i>.</p>
