                    <em>A Comprehensive Bibliography on Syriac Christianity</em>
                </h1>
                <h2>Edited by Sergey Minov</h2>
                <h3>Introduction: </h3>
                <p>[DRAFT PROSE HERE] It was during the sixteenth century in Renaissance Europe that, as a result of
                    the efforts of the Catholic and Protestant scholars of the New Testament, Syriac
                    studies became a part of European intellectual life. Since then, the number of
                    scholarly publications on various matters related to the history, culture and
                    religious life of Syriac-speaking Christians has only increased. As these
                    publications are in a variety of languages, and many of them scattered through
                    journals and periodicals belonging to various academic fields, it is often
                    difficult to obtain precise information on what has already been published on
                    one or another aspect of Syriac Christianity. Our project aims to fill the
                    evident gap in the bibliographical resources and provide a convenient and easily
                    accessible tool for the worldwide scholarly community. The ultimate goal of this
                    project is to create and launch an on-line database on Syriac Christianity that
                    will be updated on a regular basis and available free of charge to the
                    international scholarly community.</p>
                <!--  <p> Citation of sources is a defining aspect of Syriaca.org's approach to digital
                    scholarship. Our editorial principles require that all interpretive claims and
                    collected data published by Syriaca.org include citations to the sources from
                    which they were derived. Our editorial policy is to strongly prefer the use of
                    persistent and durable sources, such as peer-reviewed academic publications or
                    direct citation of primary sources (such as manuscripts), so that all claims can
                    be verified or revised by consulting the original source. The <em>Syriaca.org:
                        Works Cited</em> database is designed to help researchers in identifying the
                    sources used by Syriaca.org. </p>
                <p> All digital publications of Syriaca.org share this common works cited database.
                    Each source is assigned a <a href="../documentation/terms.html#uri">Uniform
                        Resource Identifier (URI)</a>. Such URIs take the form
                        <code>http://syriaca.org/bibl/\d+</code> (where "\d+" indicates a unique
                    string of one or more numerals). As an example,
                        <code>http://syriaca.org/bibl/1396</code> represents the journal article: <a
                        href="http://syriaca.org/bibl/1396">P. Peeters, "Le martyrologe de Rabban
                        Ṣalība," <em>Analecta Bollandiana</em> vol. 27 (1908), 129-200.</a> The use
                    of shared URIs across Syriaca.org not only ensures standardized citation but
                    also opens up new possibilities for exploring networks of scholarship by
                    enabling researchers to search for topics or Syriaca.org entries which are
                    connected by shared source materials. The <em>Syriaca.org: Works Cited</em>
                    database is designed to make visible these underlying bibliographic
                    relationships and to serve as a tool for analyzing the history of Syriac studies
                    as a discipline. </p>
                <p> The bibliographic records published in <em>Syriaca.org: Works Cited</em> have
                    been encoded following the guidelines of the <a
                        href="http://www.tei-c.org/index.xml">Text Encoding Initiative (TEI)</a>, a
                    best practice in digital scholarship. For ease of use, many of the records are
                    also available through a <a
                        href="https://www.zotero.org/groups/syriaca.org_test_bibliography_module/items"
                        >Zotero</a> library which can be downloaded in a number of standard formats
                    including <a href="https://www.zotero.org/support/dev/data_formats">MODS XML,
                        RIS, CSL JSON, and BibTex</a>. For reuse or linking, however, the canonical
                    version of the citation record is the TEI document hosted on Syriaca.org with a
                    URI of the following format: <code>http://syriaca.org/bibl/\d+</code>. When
                    applicable, Syriaca.org has provided links to online versions of the
